# Agents

This file provides guidance to coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## General

- Never commit code to git!
- Don't change shadcn code in `elements/`
- Prioritize using LSP capabilities if possible
- When resolving a TODO, follow its instructions literally
- Run type checking as part of your tasks
- Run specs as part of your tasks
- Don't run linting as part of your tasks

## Commands

- Run `pnpm lint` to lint the code
- Run `pnpm format` to auto-fix formatting issues
- Run `pnpm type` to check TypeScript types
- Run `pnpm test` to run the full test suite including linting, type checking, and tests
- Run `pnpm unit` to run only the Vitest tests
- Run `pnpm exec vitest run -t "test name"` or `pnpm exec vitest run path/to/test.ts` to run a single test
- Run `pnpm docs:start` to serve the landing site and `pnpm docs:build` to build it

## Structure

- The renderer (React SPA) lives flat at the repository root: `routes/`, `components/`,
  `elements/`, `hooks/`, `helpers/`, `services/`, `constants/`, `styles/`, `locales/`
- Electron process code lives under `processes/main/` and `processes/preload/`
- `models/` holds the zod schemas shared by the renderer and the engine — the oRPC wire contract
- The renderer must never import from `#processes/*`, `electron` or `node:*`; the only legal
  crossing is the type-only `Router` import in `services/engine.ts` (enforced by oxlint)
- `.livemark/` is the landing site published at application.fairspec.org, built with livemark and
  deployed to Cloudflare as static assets. It is independent of the Electron app, is English-only
  and outside the i18n workflow, and its dependencies must stay in `devDependencies` so they never
  reach the installer

## i18n

- Any change that adds or edits a user-facing string must run `pnpm extract` and then fill
  `msgstr` for every new or changed message in all seven non-source catalogues
- `pt` is European Portuguese, never Brazilian
- `lingui extract` reports a Total count that **includes obsolete entries**. A `#~ msgid` whose
  string no longer exists still counts, and grepping `^msgstr ""` will never find it because the
  line is `#~ msgstr ""`. Parse with `@lingui/format-po`'s own `parse()` to see what is genuinely
  untranslated, or run `pnpm extract --clean` to drop obsolete entries
- Long msgids wrap across lines in the PO, so naive text replacement silently misses them. Fill
  those through the same parser and `serialize()` rather than string surgery

## Formats

- Use 2-space indentation, UTF-8 encoding, and LF line endings
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces, and camelCase for methods and variables
- Place high-level public items first in a file and low-level private items last
- Use ES modules with full import paths including the ".ts(x)" file extension

## Types

- Use strict TypeScript with null checks but don't add explicit return types to functions
- Never use TypeScript `any`, type casting `as`, or `!` without permission

## Specs

- Place unit tests in `<module>.unit.ts` files and don't add useless comments like "Arrange", "Act", "Assert"

## Docs

- Add Typedoc comments only for public APIs and don't add them for files or use @params directives
- Don't write `//` comments in the code
